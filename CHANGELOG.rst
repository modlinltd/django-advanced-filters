--------------------------

Bugs
~~~~

- updated AdvancedFilterQueryForm to include numeric comparison operators (Merge d3ee9f4)
- Fixed a bug where editing an existing Advanced Filter defaulted all operators to 'Equals' (Merge d3ee9f4)
- set AFQFormSet extra=0 instead of extra=1. I did this because having to check Delete is not clear to end users. (Merge d3ee9f4)
- changed the Advanced Filter admin so you a User by default can only view/edit filters that they create (unless they are a superuser) (Merge d3ee9f4)
- Fixed failing tests. Fixed bug where users weren't properly getting permissions to change or delete their filters (Merge d3ee9f4)

- pep8 fix (Merge d3ee9f4)
- Fixed labeling error with 'Greater Than or Equal To' (Merge d3ee9f4)

- Revert "select2 only initializes if there are choices available. otherwise, the standard text input will be used" (Merge 35d7063)
- updated query for choices for select2 field so that it will take only distinct choices. This allows max_choices to be the maximum unique choices. (Merge 35d7063)
- Changes URL declaration to avoid deprecated pattern (Merge 35d7063)
- refactored retrieval of choices so that the db is getting distinct values; added test (Merge 35d7063)
