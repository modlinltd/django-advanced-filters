A django ModelAdmin mixin which adds advanced filtering abilities to the
admin.

Mimics the advanced search feature in
`VTiger <https://www.vtiger.com/>`__, `see here for more
info <https://wiki.vtiger.com/index.php/Create_Custom_Filters>`__

For release notes, see `Changelog <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modlinltd/django-advanced-filters/develop/CHANGELOG.rst>`__

Requirements
============

-  Django >= 1.5 (Django 1.5 - 1.9 on Python 2/3/PyPy2)
-  django-braces == 1.4.0
-  simplejson == 3.6.5

*NOTE*: While the latest Django 1.5.X is supported, the bundled jQuery it includes is outdated (1.4.2) and as such, most of our admin frontend scripts fail. This means that to use advanced-filters in Django 1.5 admin, you'd have to probably include your own jQuery (1.9 or later) and add it to global namespace prior to other scripts in `AdvancedFilterForm.Meta`.

Installation & Set up
=====================

1. Install from pypi: ``pip install django-advanced-filters``
2. Add both ``'advanced_filters'`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
3. Add ``url(r'^advanced_filters/', include('advanced_filters.urls'))``
   to your project's urlconf.
4. Run ``python manage.py syncdb`` or ``python manage.py migrate`` (for django >= 1.7)

Integration Example
===================

Extending a ModelAdmin is pretty straightforward:

.. code-block:: python

    from advanced_filters.admin import AdminAdvancedFiltersMixin

    class ProfileAdmin(AdminAdvancedFiltersMixin, models.ModelAdmin):
        list_filter = ('name', 'language', 'ts')   # simple list filters

        # select from these fields in the advanced filter creation form
        advanced_filter_fields = (
            'name', 'language', 'ts'
            # even use related fields as lookup fields
            'country__name', 'posts__title', 'comments__content'
        )

Adding a new advanced filter (see below) will display a new list filter
named "Advanced filters" which will list all the filter the currently
logged in user is allowed to use (by default only those he/she created).

Custom naming of fields
-----------------------

Initially, each field in ``advanced_filter_fields`` is resolved into an
actual model field. That field's verbose\_name attribute is then used as
the text of the displayed option. While uncommon, it occasionally makes
sense to use a custom name, especially when following a relationship, as
the context then changes.

For example, when a profile admin allows filtering by a user name as
well as a sales representative name, it'll get confusing:

.. code-block:: python

    class ProfileAdmin(AdminAdvancedFiltersMixin, models.ModelAdmin):
        advanced_filter_fields = ('name', 'sales_rep__name')

In this case the field options will both be named "name" (by default).

To fix this, use custom naming:

.. code-block:: python

    class ProfileAdmin(AdminAdvancedFiltersMixin, models.ModelAdmin):
        advanced_filter_fields = ('name', ('sales_rep__name', 'assigned rep'))

Now, you will get two options, "name" and "assigned rep".

Adding new advanced filters
===========================

By default the mixin uses a template which extends django's built-in
``change_list`` template. This template is based off of grapelli's fork
of this template (hence the 'grp' classes and funny looking javascript).

The default template also uses the superb
`magnificPopup <dimsemenov/Magnific-Popup>`__ which is currently bundled
with the application.

Regardless of the above, you can easily write your own template which
uses context variables ``{{ advanced_filters }}`` and
``{{ advanced_filters.formset }}``, to render the advanced filter
creation form.

Structure
=========

Each advanced filter has only a couple of required fields when
constructed with the form; namely the title and a formset (consisting of
a form for each sub-query or rule of the filter query).

Each form in the formset requires the following fields: ``field``,
``operator``, ``value``

And allows the optional ``negate`` and ``remove`` fields.

Let us go over each of the fields in a rule fieldset.

Field
-----

The list of all available fields for this specific instance of the
ModelAdmin as specific by the ```advanced_filter_fields``
property. <#integration-example>`__

The OR field
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``OR`` is an additional field that is added to every rule's available
fields.

It allows constructing queries with `OR
statements <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/queries/#complex-lookups-with-q-objects>`__.
You can use it by creating an "empty" rule with this field "between" a
set of 1 or more rules.

Operator
--------

Query field suffixes which specify how the ``WHERE`` query will be
constructed.

The currently supported are as follows: ``iexact``, ``icontains``,
``iregex``, ``range``, ``isnull``, ``istrue`` and ``isfalse``

For more detail on what they mean and how they function, see django's
`documentation on field
lookups <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#field-lookups>`__.

Value
-----

The value which the specific sub-query will be looking for, i.e the
value of the field specified above, or in django query syntax:
``.filter(field=value)``

Negate
------

A boolean (check-box) field to specify whether this rule is to be
negated, effectively making it a "exclude" sub-query.

Remove
------

Similarly to other `django
formsets <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/formsets/>`__,
used to remove the selected line on submit.

Editing previously created advanced filters
===========================================

The ``AdvancedFilterAdmin`` class (a subclass of ``ModelAdmin``) is
provided and registered with ``AdvancedFilter`` in admin.py module.

The model's change\_form template is overridden from grapelli's/django's
standard template, to mirror the add form modal as closely as possible.

*Note:* currently, adding new filters from the ModelAdmin change page is
not supported.

Query Serialization
===================

**TODO:** write a few words on how serialization of queries is done.

Model correlation
=================

Since version 1.0, ``AdvancedFilter`` are tightly coupled with a specific model
using the ``model`` field and the app\_label.Name template.
On creation, ``model`` is populated based on the admin changelist it's created
in.

This change has a few benefits:

1. The mixin can be used with multiple ``ModelAdmin`` classes while
   performing specific query serialization and field validation that are
   at the base of the filter functionality.

2. Users can edit previously created filters outside of the
   context of a changelist, as we do in the
   ```AdvancedFilterAdmin`` <#editing-previously-created-advanced-filters>`__.

3. Limit the ``AdvancedListFilters`` to limit queryset (and thus, the
   underlying options) to a specified model.

Views
=====

The GetFieldChoices view is required to dynamically (using javascript)
fetch a list of valid field choices when creating/changing an
``AdvancedFilter``.

TODO
====

-  Add permission user/group selection functionality to the filter form
-  Allow toggling of predefined templates (grappelli / vanilla django
   admin), and front-end features.
-  Support more (newer) python/django versions
